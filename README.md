# EDA-Retail

Here, we have to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the data set 'Sample Superstore'. As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to
make more profit. What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data? 

This is a part of my internship at The Sparks Foundation: Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP) in the Data Science and Business Analytics domain.
